The control sequence at the end of the top line

misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,

Dimensions can be in units of em, ex, in, pt, pc,
cm, mm, dd, cc, nd, nc, bp, or sp; but yours is a new one!
I'll assume that you meant to say pt, for printer's points.
To recover gracefully from this error, it's best to
delete the erroneous units; e.g., type `2' to delete
two letters. (See Chapter 27 of The TeXbook.)

I can't figure out why you would want to use a tab mark
or \cr or \span just now. If something like a right brace
up above has ended a previous alignment prematurely,
you're probably due for more error messages, and you
might try typing `S' now just to see what is salvageable.

! Misplaced \noalign.
\@cline ...ht \arrayrulewidth \hfill \cr \noalign 
                                                  {\vskip -\arrayrulewidth }
l.10 ...Einarbeitung & 1. Meilenstein\\\cline{1-3}
                                                  
I expect to see \noalign only after the \cr of
an alignment. Proceed, and I'll ignore this case.
